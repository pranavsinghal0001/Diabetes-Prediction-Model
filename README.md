# Diabetes Prediction

## Overview
This project is a **Diabetes Prediction** model implemented in Python using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical and lifestyle-related features.

## Dataset
The model is trained on a diabetes dataset containing various health-related parameters such as glucose levels, BMI, age, insulin, and other factors.

## Features Used
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run **Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Model Training & Evaluation
- The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and normalizing features.
- Various ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated.
- Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** (Replace with actual result).
- Feature importance analysis was conducted to understand significant predictors.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by tuning hyperparameters.
- Experiment with deep learning models for better performance.
- Deploy the model as a web application for real-time predictions.
