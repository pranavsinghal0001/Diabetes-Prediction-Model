# Diabetes Prediction 🩺📊

## Overview
This project is a **Diabetes Prediction** model implemented in Python using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a person is diabetic based on medical and lifestyle-related features.

## 📂 Dataset
The model is trained on a diabetes dataset containing various health-related parameters such as glucose levels, BMI, age, insulin, and other factors.

## 📌 Features Used
- 🏥 Pregnancies
- 🍬 Glucose
- 💓 Blood Pressure
- 🩸 Skin Thickness
- 💉 Insulin
- ⚖️ BMI
- 🧬 Diabetes Pedigree Function
- 🎂 Age

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python
- 📒 Jupyter Notebook
- 🏗️ Pandas
- 🔢 NumPy
- 🤖 Scikit-Learn
- 📊 Matplotlib & Seaborn

## 🚀 Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run **Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 🏆 Model Training & Evaluation
- The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and normalizing features.
- Various ML models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated.
- Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📈 Results
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **77%** .
- Feature importance analysis was conducted to understand significant predictors.
